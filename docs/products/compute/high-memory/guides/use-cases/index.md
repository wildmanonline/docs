## Benefits of High Memory



## Use Cases

### In-Memory Databases and Caching

Two primary applications for High Memory instances are in-memory caches and in-memory databases, like [Memcached](https://memcached.org) and [Redis](https://redis.io). These applications offer very fast retrieval of data, but they store data in a non-persistent manner (with some caveats). So, they are usually used in conjunction with another persistent database server running on a separate instance.

The kinds of data you might store in one of these applications includes: information about your users' sessions; frequently-requested pages on your website; and data that needs to be computed (for example, the average rating of a product on a retail store's site).
